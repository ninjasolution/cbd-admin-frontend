          light, fertilizer, irrigation, grid, variety and many other factors.
          The price offered by Cannerald may be higher or lower depending on
          supply/demand. We cannot guarantee a purchase or stable prices for
          your harvested CBD, the quality and quantity will be optimized from
          crop to crop and at best increased. The harvested results (and the
          example above) will be deducted with our additional costs (35 EUR per
          grow), the remaining amount will be split 50/50 between the company
          and the plant-owner.
